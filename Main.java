package noahsark;//
//Design and implement an application that represents the day that Noah’s Ark was open, just before
//the rain started. In your script, create an animal of each species and then call them all in. Every animal must implement a method call() that prints on screen the appropriate message. You should
//keep in mind the following requirements:
//        • The application should contain at least: bears, beetles, cats, crocodiles, dogs, dolphins, eagles,
//flies, frogs, lizards, monkeys, owls (of course), pigeons, salmon, sharks, snakes, whales.
//        • All animals have at least a method call() and a method reproduce() (for after the rain).
//        • Insects, fish, amphibians, reptiles, and birds lay eggs (layEggs()). Mammals cannot lay eggs
//but give birth1
//        (giveBirth()). The method reproduce() should call the appropriate method in
//each case.
//        • When called, all animals answer (i.e., print on screen) “<name of the animal> coming...”. The
//exceptions are aquatic animals, which are not affected by the rain and answer “<name of the
//animal> will not come...”; and flying animals, which answer “<name of the animal> now flying, will come later when tired...”. Method call() must not be implemented in every class:
//use inheritance to reuse methods and constructors to pass information to parent classes.
//• All animals make a sound. If Animal is an interface in your design, makeSound() must be
//a method in there; if Animal is an abstract class, it must be an abstract method. The
//method can then be implemented by descendant classes
